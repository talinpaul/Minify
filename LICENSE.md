#The License:
You (from this point on referred to as The You) are hereby
granted by me (from this point on referred to as The Me)
license to knock yourself silly with this template.
By using this template The You implicitly accepts this
license and pledges solemnly to never claim creative
ownership of any graphics, code, concepts, eggs, bacon, ideas,
colors, shapes, hypertext-transfer protocols or other conduits
of the visual splendor thatis this template.

The Me, in turn, pledges equally solemnly to be far too
lazy to ever check up on you, so if you do manage to pull
some chicks The Me won't have a cow.
However The Me would be sorely disappointed if The You
were to try and sell or distribute this work without
acknowledging The Me. Seriously. The Me will come down on
The You like a large quantitiy of hard and heavy objects
that in large quantities may be harmful and possibly even
lethal to The You; So don't even think about it, The Buster.
